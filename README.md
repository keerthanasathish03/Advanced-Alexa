# JARVIS-AI

As the name suggests, it's an AI Voice Assistant.

In 2020 4.2 billion digital voice assistants were used.

Why?
I created JARVIS with two goals in mind:

1. It should have a lot of useful features (both fun and commonly used).
2. Anyone can contribute to this project. (As this is module-based, anybody with a decent knowledge of Python can contribute.) One of the prime goals of this project is to lower the entry barrier into the world of open source.

Functions
1. It asks you a question
2. Plays songs
3. Opens YouTube
4. Opens Google
5. Talks about someone with the information from Wikipedia
6. Tells us the time
7. Tells us a joke
8. Plays us a recipe in YouTube

I have already published a repository of a voice assistant which had few commands.
